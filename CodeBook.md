run_analysis.R() if a function to extract and summarize data from the output measurements associated with the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data found at this URL: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Appendix A describes the original data that was the begining point for the run_analysis resulting output.

The goal of this project was to produce a dataset that summarized a subset of the 561 features, by experiment subject and subject activitye, to associate those selected 79 features with the appropriate subject id feature and associated activity performed, and to provide a summary file giving the mean of the 79 numeric values for each subject/ activity combination. The resulting output consists of 180 summary records. 

The original data contained 10,299 records with 561 features related to the subject's movements while conduting various activities. These 10,299 records were split by the original team into training and testing datasets, with test set containing 2,947 records and the train set containing the remaining 7,352 records. 

Of the 561 features, 79 were extracted by filtering the feature column headings. The 79 columns selected contain either of the literals "mean" or "std". The filtered column names were used to create an index that was used to extract the columns from the test and train datasets mentioned above. The columns that were extracted and incorporated into the final file are shown in Appendix B. The original list of 561 variables can be found in features.txt in the "\getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset\UCI HAR Dataset\" data directory. These are not included here due to the size of this list.

Associated subject and activity ids were provided in separate files and were added to the data frames which were created for test and train. Activities were initially represented by a numeric id which was associated with a text descriptive name. In the intermediate steps the activity ids were replaced with their equivalent human readable description. The source id had no cooresponding descriptive value and so remained coded as a numeric identifier. 

Once the test and train data frames were built the were bound together into a single data frame consisting of the 10,299 records and column headings were added. The column names remain unchanged from the original due to the fact that they are somewhat descriptive of the underlyig data and need to remain unique to eventually get to the data required. In the preprocessing, attempts to make the column headings less "cryptic" revealed that there were duplicate names. One attempt to strip off the leading numeric column identity resulted in duplicate column names and further processing was flawed. The column names in the resulting data set must be interpreted to be "the mean of" the column name. Further work in this regard would require a deep understanding of the underlying data that goes beyond the goal of this project.

One a single data frame was created, it was 'melted' using the reshape2 library funtion and an intermediate file was created the had one row per subject/ activity/ measurement giving 818,621 records. from the reshape2, 'dcast' was used to summarize these records into 180 records consiting of 79 means for each subject/ activity combination. The means were column means for each subject/ activity combination.

This process produces two data set:

* comboMeasurements.csv
* tidyMeasurements.csv

comboMeasurements is the merged test and train data with 10,299 data records with the subject, activity, and 79 readings per record. This is the raw data that was then molded into the tinyMeasurements dataset with 180 records, on for each subject/ activity combination with 79 column mean entries.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
